## Upload Your Product Catalog

Upload a complete, up-to-date product catalog so our AI can precisely extract and match inbound purchase orders, quotes, and line items. The richer and cleaner your catalog, the more accurate our matching and downstream automation will be.

Use this section to upload:

- Full product lists (SKU, description, UOM, etc.)
- Customer-specific contract items (if applicable)
- Replacement SKUs or obsolete → active mappings

Endeavor continuously learns from this data and this is the foundation of accurate order entry.

## Create Groups

Organize your team into Groups to track performance in ways that reflect how you operate.

Common examples:

- By region
  - "California Division"
  - "Midwest Branches"
- By store or branch
  - "Phoenix – Store 12"
- By customer team or CAM ownership
  - "Sidney — CAM 2 Team"

Groups allow you to filter analytics, drill into throughput, and understand performance across different parts of your organization.

## Roles

Create roles that match how responsibilities are distributed across your team.

Examples:

- Admin
  Full access to all orders, analytics, and system settings.
- Standard
  Typically has "View all orders" + "View all analytics" (fully customizable).
- Custom Roles
  Tailor permissions for unique workflows, such as:
  - "CSR – Order Entry Only"
  - "Manager – Approvals Required"
  - "Pricing Locked / No Overrides"

Roles help maintain clean governance and ensure only the right people can submit, edit, or approve orders.

## Users

Invite users by entering:

- Email address
- Assigned role
- Temporary password

Once added, users will receive login instructions and be prompted to create their own password. From there, they can begin processing orders, reviewing matched line items, and contributing to AI accuracy.
