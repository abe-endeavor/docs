## Overview

Because teams spend so much of their day managing orders in Outlook, we built an embedded AI agent to act as their assistant.

### Step 1: Open Endeavor Omelas Agent

If you navigate to your email, you'll see the "Endeavor Omelas" button at the top right.

- Login with the same credentials as web portal (username + new password you made)

### Step 2: Order Upload Methods

You can upload orders using the three methods listed:

1. Drag-and-drop the entire email into the chat window → when you want all attachments + email body in order context
2. Drag-and-drop attachments => when you only need the attachments to be processed
3. Paper clip icon → to manually upload attachments from files

You can directly begin processing by clicking "Upload directly to Endeavor" or just type a command in chat to do so.

  src="/images/up-load.png"
  alt="Upload directly to Endeavor option in chat interface"
/>

Once uploaded, it will get sent to the Orders tab in the web portal. You can then go and review it like normal.

Success👏!
