## Upsell and Cross-Sell AI

Cross-Sell & Up-Sell identifies where existing customers are likely to spend more. By analyzing SKU-level buying patterns across your order history, Endeavor uncovers product pairs, complementary items, and customer accounts with clear expansion potential.

Instead of guessing which products to recommend or manually combing through past orders, the system surfaces:

- High-frequency product pairings that naturally go together
- Trigger products that reliably signal a related purchase
- Customers who haven't ordered their usual items recently
- Account-specific product insights to guide targeted outreach

It gives sales and CSR teams a ready-made list of revenue opportunities.

## Customer and Product Insights

Customer & Product Insights surfaces the signals that matter most for retaining revenue, identifying churn risk, and understanding product performance. Instead of manually digging through ERP reports, Endeavor automatically analyzes historical ordering behavior and highlights where attention is needed.

- Frequently paired products your customers often buy together
- Trigger → recommended product relationships based on real historical co-purchase frequency
- Customers worth reaching out to based on inactivity or declining order cadence
- Regularly purchased items per customer to personalize outreach

This turns passive historical data into actionable sales motions.
