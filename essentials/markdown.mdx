## Overview

Endeavor's Order Entry Automation ingests purchase orders from email or manual drag-and-drop uploads, extracts and validates all line items against the product catalog, and generates fully processed ERP orders with minimal CSR input. CSRs can review, correct, and approve orders prior to final ERP submission.

## Step 1: Ingestion
Endeavor supports both automated and manual ingestion, allowing teams to capture POs regardless of format or source.

    A chat-style AI side panel appears directly in Outlook or Gmail, enabling CSRs to:

    - Ask questions about the PO
    - Request corrections or context
    - Interact with the agent without leaving their inbox

</Columns>


## Step 2: Extraction

Once a PO is ingested, Endeavor’s extraction engine pulls out every required field and aligns it with your product catalog.
### AI Extraction Includes

- Item quantities
- SKUs / product IDs
- Product descriptions
- Pricing 
- Customer identifiers
- Ship-to details
- Delivery requirements
- PO metadata

### Validation Engine

- Checks all items against your product catalog
- Detects missing, invalid, or ambiguous fields
- Flags mismatches and exceptions early
- Learns corrections over time (self-improvement)

## Step 3: Processing

After extraction and validation, Endeavor prepares the order for ERP submission. 

### Key Processing Capabilities

- Catalog validation
- ERP read/writeback
- Real-time error detection
- Exception handling for unknown items or custom logic
- Review & confirm workflow
- CSR approves or edits before submission
- Revisions retrain the model
- Order routing based on business rules
- Supports pricing rules, contract accounts, custom ship-to mappings

### Review & Confirm Workflow
Before anything is submitted to your ERP:
- CSRs review the AI-generated order
- They can edit line items or metadata
- Any corrections retrain the model for future accuracy

Once approved, the order is pushed into the ERP as a fully processed, accurate transaction.
